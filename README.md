# Microduino-IDE
Updated Microduino core files to run under Arduino 1.5.7 for the 644 and 1284 processors only. Easy enough to update for other boards as well but I do not have all the configs to test the changes on.

Changes based on efforts of Benjamin Podszun: https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!msg/developers/Uy7ecdkIa1M/_L8GwjSy0OEJ
