# Microduino-IDE
Updated Microduino core files to run under Arduino 1.5.7 for the 644 and 1284 processors only. Easy enough to update for other boards as well but I do not have all the configs to test the changes on.

Changes based on efforts of Benjamin Podszun: https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!msg/developers/Uy7ecdkIa1M/_L8GwjSy0OEJ

To install copy and paste the Mricroduino directory from the repository into the hardware directory of the Arduino IDE directory that you created.  After you do this the directory should look something like this:

hardware
---arduino
===Microduino
---tools
  
  Thats is.
